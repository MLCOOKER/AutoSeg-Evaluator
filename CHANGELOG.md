## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-22

First public release of the v2 rewrite. Full migration from the single-window
PyQt5 prototype (`GUI23v13.py`) to a modular four-tab PySide6 application with
substantially expanded clinical functionality.

### Added
- Four-tab workflow: Load Data → Match Contours → Compute → Results.
- Organ-drawer accordion UI grouping multi-patient comparisons by structure.
- Save / load session JSON for resuming curated matches across runs.
- TG-263 synonym dictionary (663 canonical names, ~17 000 variants generated
  from the official TG-263 worksheet via `scripts/build_synonyms.py`) with
  per-match provenance badges (`tg263_exact` vs `fuzzy`).
- STAPLE consensus mode per drawer, including per-rater sensitivity /
  specificity (Warfield et al. 2004) and consensus uncertainty summary
  metrics (uncertain-band volume, mean entropy, rater disagreement).
- Volume + centre-of-mass offset metrics (cc, signed Δx/Δy/Δz mm).
- Truncation reporting (slices removed + extent in mm) for fair comparison
  on structures with high-variability craniocaudal extent.
- DVH integration via `dicompyler-core` with user-defined D<sub>X</sub>%
  and V<sub>X</sub>Gy points alongside Dmin/Dmean/Dmax.
- Visualisation dialog with CT overlay + mouse-wheel slice scrolling.
- Dark / light theme toggle (`View → Theme`) with a VS Code-inspired
  high-contrast dark palette.
- Manage Source Labels dialog with bulk-apply for multi-row overrides.

### Changed
- GUI framework migrated PyQt5 → PySide6 (LGPL).
- DICOM linking now uses `FrameOfReferenceUID` instead of `StudyInstanceUID`,
  correctly grouping RTSSes whose vendors changed the StudyUID (e.g. ZZZ_AC
  anonymisation pipelines).
- Organ-name matching uses the v1 Levenshtein + cosine hybrid with the
  TG-263 dictionary as the bridging layer; `rapidfuzz` was evaluated and
  rejected (subset-overlap behaviour scored unrelated organs too high).
- Results table emits columns in a stable canonical order regardless of run
  configuration; column headers carry physical units (mm, cc, Gy).
- Anonymisation alias merging: shared `FrameOfReferenceUID` across different
  `PatientID` values now collapse to the patient with image series attached.

### Fixed
- Surface-distance spacing order: v1 inadvertently passed `(x, y, z)` to
  `(z, y, x)`-ordered numpy arrays, producing incorrect physical distances
  on anisotropic CT. v2 reorders correctly and is bit-for-bit identical to
  `google-deepmind/surface-distance` and PlatiPy's APL on the SAMPLE DATA
  cohort.
- APL implementation now matches PlatiPy's `compute_metric_mean_apl` /
  `compute_metric_total_apl` exactly, including the NaN return for empty
  slice sets.
- Mean Surface Distance now returns NaN when either direction is NaN
  (matches v1's published values).
- Matcher canonical-case bug: when the dictionary resolved one side of a
  comparison but not the other, the case mismatch between the (preserved)
  TG-263 canonical and the (lowercased) fuzzy fallback broke Lev/cosine
  comparisons (`Eye_L` could lose to `Kidney_L` over `Eye Globe Left`).
  Fix lowercases canonicals and uses the cleaned-but-not-substituted raw
  forms for fuzzy fallback.
- Stale ticks in the Loaded Contours tree after drawer mutations — replaced
  the incremental mark/unmark approach with an authoritative re-sync from
  current drawer state after every mutation.

### Performance
- Per-patient cache eviction in the metrics worker: peak RAM is now bounded
  by a single patient's CT + masks rather than the entire cohort.
- CT volume released after the last drawer in each patient finishes mask
  rasterisation but before metric computation begins (~200 MB peak saving).
- Result groups sorted patient-major so eviction can happen at patient
  boundaries with no re-reads from disk.

### Internal
- 245-test pytest suite covering: surface distance vs `google-deepmind`,
  APL vs PlatiPy, TG-263 bridging + pitfall pairs, matcher regressions,
  session save/load round-trip, results table layout, source-label cascade,
  truncation extent reporting, STAPLE consensus, widget assembly.
